		// rather than imported there, so that marketplace-common does not drag it into every consumer.
		// ⚠️ **The access token the call arrived with, `access:` prefix and all**. Read exactly as
		// `authorizationLogoutHandler` reads it — the header, `Bearer ` stripped — so that the rotation can
		// retire it instead of leaving it live for the rest of its 30-to-90-minute window alongside its own
		// successor. A client whose access token has already expired sends none, and that is the ordinary
		// case: `refreshSessionTokens` deletes nothing rather than treating the absence as an error.
		//
		// Two statements rather than one chain, so that only the first `?.` is exempted: `ctx.request.header`
		// cannot be nullish here — this resolver runs behind the authorization middleware, which returns
		// without throwing only after reading `ctx.request.header?.cookie` as a defined string, which is
		// impossible unless the header object is itself defined. The `?.` on `authorization` genuinely can
		// short-circuit, is the ordinary case, and stays mutable so the tests below have to keep killing it.
