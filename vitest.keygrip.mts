 * could be mistaken for one, or copied into an environment file.

 * Mint a throwaway KEK and a keygrip record for the integration run (ADR-034).
 *
 * ⚠️ **Nothing boots without this.** Since ADR-034 the signing keys are a Redis record rather than two
 * environment variables, so an integration suite that only sets env starts a service that refuses to
 * start — correctly. Seeding is therefore part of provisioning the run, next to the throwaway database
 * and the throwaway CSFLE key, and for the same reason: the suite owns its secrets and destroys them
 * with the run.
 *
 * ⚠️ **The KEK is minted here and exported through `process.env`.** vitest forks its workers after
 * `globalSetup` returns, so they inherit it — the same mechanism `SEED_DEMO` already relies on. It is
 * never read from the developer's environment file: a test run must not be able to touch, or be
 * confused by, the key the real services use. Random every run, unlike the keys it wraps: nothing
 * needs to predict it, so nothing should be able to.
