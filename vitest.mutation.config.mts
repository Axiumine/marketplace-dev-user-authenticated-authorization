// Vitest config used by Stryker's vitest-runner (`yarn test:mutation`).
//
// It mirrors the `unit` project of vitest.config.mts and nothing else:
//   - No coverage block. Mutants deliberately break the code, so line-coverage
//     thresholds are meaningless here — the mutation score is the metric.
//   - No `integration` project. Stryker re-runs the suite once per mutant; pointing that at
//     test/integration/*.itest.mts would hammer the real Redis cluster AND the real MongoDB
//     hundreds of times inside this service's own `marketplaceDev:itest:userAuthenticatedAuthorization:`
//     namespace, where `fileParallelism: false` serialises everything. Unit tests mock both
//     datasources, so mutant runs stay hermetic and parallelisable.
//
// Keep the plugins/resolve/inline settings in sync with vitest.config.mts — the
// `.mjs -> .mts` NodeNext rewrite and the single-graphql-realm pinning are load
// bearing, not preferences.
// ⚠️ The last two are not decoration. An externalised dependency is loaded by Node's own resolver,
// which never consults vitest's mock registry — so a `vi.mock('@axiumine/koa-utils/lib/tokens')` in a
// test file stops intercepting the moment the import that needs faking is made from *inside* another
// package rather than from `src/`. That is exactly what the shared session helpers do: `refresh.mts`
// now delegates to marketplace-common's `refreshSessionTokens`, which imports `setLoginCookies` and
// the token generators itself. Without these two entries the dry run fails outright — the real
// `setLoginCookies` runs against a stub context and the rotation answers a GraphQLError.
