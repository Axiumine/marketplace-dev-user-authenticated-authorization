/*
 * The other half of ADR-034's boot gate: no record at all, rather than a record this process cannot open.
 *
 * Two failures, two tests, because they need two different fixes and the message has to say which. A
 * missing record means nobody has minted a key set yet — or Redis was flushed — and the admin runs the
 * seed script; a mismatched KEK (keygripFailure.itest.mts) means a key set exists and THIS service is the
 * one that is wrong. A boot log that conflated them would send an admin to edit an environment file
 * that is already correct.
 *
 * ⚠️ The record is not deleted to produce this. The suite's own record is shared by every file in the
 * project, and a test that removed it would leave the run's remaining files booting against a fleet with
 * no keys — the failure would look like this test's own subject and be blamed on the wrong thing. Pointing
 * REDIS_KEY at an empty namespace under the same ACL-granted stem asks the same question and touches
 * nothing: `keygripKey()` reads the prefix at call time, so this is exactly the "record has not been
 * seeded here" case, seen from a service that is otherwise perfectly configured.
