/*
 * The boot gate of ADR-034, against the real record in the real Redis.
 *
 * The whole point of moving the signing keys out of five environment files is that a service holding
 * the wrong key STOPS instead of starting and signing cookies its siblings cannot verify. That is a
 * property of the boot sequence, not of loadKeygrip — which is unit-tested against a fake store in
 * marketplace-common — so it is asserted here, where a real record written by globalSetup meets a
 * process that cannot open it.
 *
 * Its own file, and not a case inside index.itest.mts: it needs a process with nothing connected yet
 * and it ends with both datasources torn down. vitest gives each test file its own module registry, so
 * the Redis singleton this closes on the way out is not the one the rest of the suite is using.
